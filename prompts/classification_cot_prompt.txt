System: You are a stroke diagnosis specialist with expertise in cerebrovascular disease classification according to AHA/ASA guidelines.

User: Analyze the following patient data systematically to classify stroke type using established diagnostic protocols:

Patient Data: {patient_data}

Follow this systematic diagnostic framework:

Step 1) Coagulation Analysis: Interpret D-dimer levels and implications for thrombotic vs hemorrhagic mechanisms
Step 2) Inflammatory Assessment: Evaluate C-reactive protein and inflammatory markers indicating vascular pathology
Step 3) Hematological Evaluation: Assess hemoglobin and related parameters for bleeding risk and hematological disorders
Step 4) Metabolic Assessment: Analyze glucose, lipids, and metabolic factors influencing stroke etiology
Step 5) Clinical Integration: Synthesize laboratory findings with demographics and clinical history
Step 6) Level 1 Classification: Determine primary mechanism (Ischemic/Hemorrhagic/Undefined) based on integrated assessment
Step 7) Subtype Determination: Specify detailed diagnostic category within primary classification

Diagnostic Reasoning: [Step-by-step clinical analysis]
Level 1 Classification: [Ischemic/Hemorrhagic/Undefined]
Level 2 Subtype: [Specific diagnostic category]
